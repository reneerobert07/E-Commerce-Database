# E-Commerce-Relational-Database
This project implements a relational database model for an e-commerce platform, designed to track customer orders, product inventory, returns, and reviews. This project was designed to enhance and deepen MySQL expertise by building a relational database system for an e-commerce platform. It focuses on the full lifecycle of data management, from designing the database schema to generating and querying data, all while leveraging advanced MySQL techniques to ensure efficiency, integrity, and scalability. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with various aspects of MySQL that are critical in the development of real-world database systems.
